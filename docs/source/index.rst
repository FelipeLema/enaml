.. Enaml documentation master file

Welcome to Enaml's documentation!
====================================

**E**\naml is **N**\ot **A** **M**\arkup **L**\anguage, is a tool for
building native user interfaces on top of Traits. It is a declarative
language based on Python, analogous to Qt's QML. Enaml currently supports
wxWidgets as a backend via wxPython, and Qt as a backend via PySide and PyQt4.
However, it is not tied to a single widget toolkit.

.. warning:: Enaml is currently under heavy development and the
    documentation is not always up-to-date. Please recompile in order to
    have the latest changes from the source code.
